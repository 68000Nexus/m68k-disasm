# Motorola M68000 ISA Disassembler

> Disassemble into what `as` can assemble back

This project aims to be a disassembler capable to produce assembly code that GNU
AS will translate into the same original machine code.

Currently M68000 ISA only supported is planned. This means not M680x0, but only
M68000.

It is planned to support PC trace tables, so it will know what code is exactly a
code, not data.
