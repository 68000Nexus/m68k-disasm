# Motorola 68000 Disassembler

> Disassemble into what `as` can assemble back

This project aims to be a disassembler that is capable to produce assembly code
that GNU AS will translate into the same original machine code. It's only use
case for now is Sega Mega Drive / Genesis ROM hacking. I failed to find any way
to disassemble SMD ROMs in such a way that it would be possible to assemble it
back with GNU AS. All disassemblers I tried produce either syntactically
incompatible assembly listing, or it is not the same as original binary after
translation into machine code. So I decided to build my own disassembler, that
will do exactly what I need with full control over the process and maybe more.

## Build

To build this project, you will need CMake and some modern C++ compiler like GCC
or Clang. Here is how to build it using CMake:

```
cmake -B cmake-build -S .
cmake --build cmake-build
```

It will produce a binary named `m68k-disasm` inside the `cmake-build` directory.
You can copy it somewhere to `~/.local/bin/`, `/usr/local/bin/` or other
directory that is added to your shell's `PATH` environment variable.

It works for me on Linux, It may work the same way on OSX either and it may be
not so easy on Windows. I can't see why it could impossible on OSX and Windows
to build this project, but it is not tested.

## Usage example

You may want to run this on a random binary file just to see how it works. You
can do it like this:

```
./cmake-build/m68k-disasm -o disasm.S /path/to/file.bin
```

This command will produce `disasm.S` file, that contains assembly listing.

You may assemble it back with `m68k-none-elf-as` to see if it is valid asm code
with the following command sequence. Note that you need to obtain or build by
yourself `m68k-none-elf-gcc` toolchain to run the following command sequence,
`test.ld` is already provided in this repo.

```
m68k-none-elf-as disasm.S -o a.o
m68k-none-elf-ld -T test.ld -o a.elf a.o
m68k-none-elf-objcopy -O binary a.elf a.bin
cmp /path/to/file.bin a.bin
```

This command sequence will produce `a.o`, `a.elf` intermediate files and `a.bin`
being the same binary as the `/path/to/file.bin` file, which is tested by `cmp`
command.

Speaking of the real use case: you can disassemble Sega Mega Drive (Genesis) ROM
with PC trace table to start hacking it. PC trace table is a text file
containing one decimal number per line, representing a program counter value
that it had at least once during the ROM execution. Every number must be unique
to the file. It may look like this:

```
512
518
520
526
528
532
536
540
544
548
...
```

It may contain thousands of lines ([real example](https://gist.github.com/Oxore/c93a6192314cd6bebfa847350409caf0)).
I personally got one by playing a game on a specifically modified version of
`picodrive` for this purpose. I added 4MiB table and made emulator write all
program counter values in it and then dumped the table into a file using
`printf` function in `picodrive` C source code. You can do this with you
favorite open source emulator too.

When PC trace table file is obtained, pass it with option `-t pc-trace.txt`
alongside with the ROM you were playing off of (`rom.bin`) while gathering the
trace table.

```
./cmake-build/m68k-disasm -t pc-trace.txt -o disasm.S rom.bin
```

Or better with labeled locations analysis and some fancy raw comments:

```
./cmake-build/m68k-disasm -frdc -fxrefs-to -fxrefs-from -flabels -fabs-labels -frel-labels -fexport-labels -fexport-functions -t pc-trace.txt -o disasm.S rom.bin
```

It will produce `disasm.S` which you can modify and assemble as shown in
previous examples.

To get detailed help you can run:

```
./cmake-build/m68k-disasm -h
```

## Project goals

Goals of this Motorola 68000 disassembler project in this particular repo:
- Support all Motorola 68000 ISA instructions.
- Flawless compatibility with GNU AS syntax. It should always emit the code on
  which GNU AS produces absolutely identical binary (with or without linkage)
  without errors or warnings, unless some peculiar flags has been specified.
- Support PC trace tables. With trace tables it will disassemble traced PC
  locations only, without attempt to disassemble everything, because not
  everything is instruction, some code is just data.
- Label jump locations and bind jumps and calls to them. Label obvious ROM read
  accessed locations and bind the instructions to the labeled locations. To make
  it possible to split and reorganize the binary.

What could become a goal (possible features):
- Other Motorola 680x0 instruction sets support, including ColdFire.
- Functions and function boundaries detection.
- Static analysis of call graph of branches and subroutine calls.
- PC trace aided static analysis of dynamic branches and subroutine calls.
- Base address other than `0x00000000`. It is only zero for now because it is
  sufficient for Sega Mega Drive / Genesis ROM images.
- Support for more than 4MiB of code size.
- Sparse address space support (instead of single continuous 4MiB block that
  starts at `0x00000000` offset).
- Other assembler syntaxes (e.g. ASM68K.EXE).
- Expose a library API.

What is **not** the goal (at least not in this repo):
- Decompilation into some high level language like C or C++.
- Other instruction set architectures support like MIPS, x86, amd64, ARM,
  PowerPC and so on.

## Current state

### Features

- All M68000 instructions supported
- It generates GNU AS compatible listing, that may be translated back to machine
  code using `m68k-none-elf-as` in the way that it matches original binary file,
  no matter what.
- It generates labels for all jump instructions (JSR, JMP, BRA, Bcc and DBcc) if
  jump location is inside the code being disassembled. This feature can be
  enabled with `-flabels`, `-frel-labels` and `-fabs-labels` options, all at
  once. It also generates labels for some data accessing instructions (namely:
  NBCD, PEA, LEA, CMP, SUB, ADD, MOVEM and MOVE) and this behavior enabled with
  the same options as per jump instructions. It is possible to implement this
  for all of the rest instructions, but it just has to be done if someone needs
  it.
- Traced disassembling - you can provide a PC trace table file with option
  `--pc-trace=file` to disassemble only what is supposed to be instructions and
  leave all the rest as raw data. Otherwise it will try to disassemble
  everything.

### Limitations

- Motorola 68000 only supported. That means no 68010 support or any 680x0,
  except 68000. No ColdFire support.
- Code must be aligned to 2 bytes boundary. All PC trace values have to be
  dividable by 2 without remaining. That limitation has been put into design
  from the beginning, because 68000 cannot perform unaligned `word` and `long`
  memory access, including instruction fetch. This is not true for some of 680x0
  variations.
- Base address is always assumed to be `0x00000000`.
- Maximum binary size is 4MiB.
- Labels for locations outside of the code being disassembled are not generated,
  they remain as raw address arguments and/or PC-relative offset arguments.

## Contributing

I will eventually put this repo on GitHub, I guess. You can create issues and
pull requests there. You can [email me](mailto:oxore@protonmail.com) directly to
ask a question, send a patch or discuss problems if you prefer this over GitHub.

I decided to go without code formatting standard for now. Just be nice to not
mix up spaces with tabs (use spaces everywhere) if you are sending patch or
pull request and that's it.

C++ STL is not welcomed here. Almost every STL header (besides C standard
library wrappers like `cstring` or `cstdio`) increases compilation times
significantly. This disassembler is used to be developed on Celeron N4000
machine with eMMC memory instead of SSD and it is very sensitive to STL bullshit
increasing compile times. Please, make sure you don't use any compile time heavy
headers. If you really need something like hashmap or RB-tree, then bring some
tiny MIT/BSD/Unlicense library from somewhere or write it yourself.

Run tests when the work is done to make sure you didn't break anything.
